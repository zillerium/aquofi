🧪 Aquo is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that enables market liquidity for illiquid Real World Assets (RWAs). Our Ethereum Sidechain is dedicated to tokenization, aggregation and composition of Real World Assets (RWAs) through smart contracts and DAO governance. Aquo token holders can issue tokens for their RWAs on the native chain, swap/bridge RWA tokens from ethereum compatible chains, then aggregate RWA tokens into liquidity pools using composition strategies through our tailored RWA contracts.

⚙️ Built using NextJS, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Wagmi, Viem, ScaffoldEth and Typescript.
